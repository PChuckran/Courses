# Class 5 - Sept. 28th 2018
- In this first class we will:
    - Learn how to use lists, dictionaries and list comprehension
    - Learn about for loops and if/else statements
    - Learn about using indentation to define blocks of code

### Required Reading (**Must be completed ahead of time**)
Practical Computing for Biologists, Chapters 9-10

### Exercises

1. Use Jupyter Notebook to open "PythonPt2-Class5.ipynb". This notebook will introduce you to the Python syntax for lists, dictionaries, for loops and if/else statements. Read through each cell of the notebook and execute the contained code using "control+enter" or by pressing the play button at the top of the Notebook. Four of the cells contain exercises to complete. Enter your code for each exercise directly within the notebook cells describing the exercises. However, feel free to also make changes to the code contained in the other cells to further explore Python's syntax. 

2. For this exercise we will be revisiting the "HastingsBirdList\_2007.txt" dataset that we rearranged with regular expressions during our first class. Use your newly acquired Python coding skills to write a stand-alone script that will accomplish all of the formatting originally done with a (very complicated) regular expression. See [Class 1 Exercise 3](https://github.com/jtladner/Courses/tree/master/PracticalComputing/Fall_2018/Class1_Intro_RegExp) for a refresher. 

This script should: 
    
    1. Read in the existing file
    2. Parse the file, line by line 
    3. Write out a new file (with a different name) with the data reformatted 

## Extra fun
